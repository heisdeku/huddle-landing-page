![Design preview for the Huddle landing page with alternating feature blocks coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**To do this challenges, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
